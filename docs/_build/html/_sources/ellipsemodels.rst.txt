ap_ellipsemodel_resolution
  scale factor for the ellipse model resolution. Above 1 increases the precision of the ellipse model (and computation time), between 0 and 1 decreases
  the resolution (and computation time). Note that the ellipse model resolution is defined logarithmically, so the center will always be more resolved (float)

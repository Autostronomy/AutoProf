AutoProf Pipeline Control
=========================

Modifying Pipeline Methods
--------------------------

This is done with the *ap_new_pipeline_methods* argument, which is formatted as a dictionary with string keys and functions as values.
In this way you can add to or alter the methods used by AutoProf in it's pipeline.

Each of the methods in :doc:`defaultpipeline` has a pipeline label, this is how the code identifies the functions and their outputs.
Thus, one can create their own version of any method and modify the pipeline by assigning the function to that label.
For example, if you wrote a new center finding method, you could update the pipeline by including:

.. code-block:: python
   
  ap_new_pipeline_methods = {'center': My_Center_Finding_Method}
		
in your config file.
You can also make up any other methods and add them to the pipeline functions list, assigning whatever key you like.
However, AutoProf will only look for methods that are in the *pipeline_steps* object, so see `Modifying Pipeline Steps`_ for how to add/remove/reorder steps in the pipeline.

Pipeline Method Template
------------------------

Every function in the pipeline has the same template.
To add a new function, or replace an existing one, you must format it as:

.. code-block:: python
   
  def My_New_Function(IMG, results, options):
      # Code here
      return IMG, {'results': of, 'the': calculations}

where *IMG* is the input image, *results* is a dictionary containing the output of all previous pipeline steps, and *options* is a dictionary with all user specified arguments (any variable in the config file that starts with *ap\_*) if they have non-default values (None).
The output of every method in the pipeline is an image and a dictionary with strings for keys.
The output image is assigned to replace the input image, so if you wish to alter the input image you can do so in a way that all future steps will see.
The dictionary output is used to update the *results* dictionary that is passed to all future methods, you can therefore add new elements to the dictionary or replace older ones. 
If you wish to replace a method, make sure to have the output follow this format.
So long as your output dictionary has the same keys/value format, it should be able to seamlessly replace a step in the pipeline.
If you wish to include more information, you can include as many other entries in the dictionary as you like, the default methods functions will ignore them.
See the corresponding documentation for the expected outputs from each function.

Modifying Pipeline Steps
------------------------

This is done with the *ap_new_pipeline_steps* argument, which is formatted as a list of strings which tells AutoProf what order to run it's pipeline methods.
In this way you can alter the order of operations used by AutoProf in it's pipeline.

Each function must be run in a specific order as they often rely on the output from another step.
The basic pipeline step order is:

.. code-block:: python
   
  ['background', 'psf', 'center', 'isophoteinit', 'isophotefit', 'isophoteextract', 'checkfit', 'writeprof']

For forced photometry the default pipeline step order is:

.. code-block:: python
   
  ['background', 'psf', 'center forced', 'isophoteinit', 'isophotefit forced', 'isophoteextract forced', 'writeprof']

If you would like to change this behaviour, just provide a *ap_new_pipeline_steps* list.
For example if you wished to use forced photometry but you want to re-fit the center you can change :func:`~autoprofutils.Center.Center_Forced` back to :func:`~autoprofutils.Center.Center_HillClimb` with:

.. code-block:: python
   
  ap_new_pipeline_steps = ['background', 'psf', 'center', 'isophoteinit', 'isophotefit forced', 'isophoteextract forced', 'writeprof']

in your config file.

You can create your own order, or add in new functions by supplying a new list.
For example, if you had your own method to run after the centering function you could do so by including:

.. code-block:: python
   
  ap_new_pipeline_methods = {'mymethod': My_New_Method}
  ap_new_pipeline_steps = ['background', 'psf', 'center', 'mymethod', 'isophoteinit', 'isophotefit', 'isophoteextract', 'checkfit', 'writeprof']

in your config file.
Note that for *ap_new_pipeline_methods* you need only include the new function, while for *ap_new_pipeline_steps* you must write out the full pipeline steps.
If you wish to skip a step, it is sometimes better to write your own "null" version of the function (and change *ap_new_pipeline_methods*) that just returns do-nothing values for it's dictionary as the other functions may still look for the output and could crash.
